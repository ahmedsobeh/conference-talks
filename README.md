# Slides to talks that I've given at conferences


## The "F" in FOSS

What if you can’t afford the “F” in FOSS? In a country that’s struggling economically, can you afford to open source even parts of your product? Will you have the capacity to have an Open Source Program Office (OSPO)?
The “F” in FOSS stands for free; what if the society itself struggles with freedom of speech, creativity, and expression?

In this talk, we will cover the immense challenges that open source faces in developing countries and the struggle that open source developers face in a commercial-product-first environment. We'll also go through approaches and measures that can be taken to build an open source culture starting by adapting an inner-source strategy that is easier to establish in these environments.

Participants will get an overview of these challenges and how we can support those who carry the flag of open source in these regions to help them grow their open source communities.


## Your OSPO is not only Yours: Working on 3rd Party OSS

In this session you will hear the story of the OSPO team at Aiven, an OSPO team that is a bit different, whose main mission is to ensure the sustainability of external OSS projects. Many organizations give financial support to OSS communities and that’s a great starting point, but communities are about people more than about money. You’ll gain insight into the origins and mission of the OSPO, the scope of its activities and how Aiven measures success and hires for roles like these.


## Managing In The Open, Managing Contributions: The challenges of OSPO developers management

Managing an Open Source Program Office (OSPO) team is undoubtedly a unique experience. In this talk I will discuss the unique challenges and best practices for managing software developers in an OSPO environment. I will cover topics such as managing remote teams, maintaining the career progression of OSPO developers, fostering a culture of collaboration and collaborating with the open source community. I will also explore the role of performance metrics in managing software developers in an OSPO, how to align those metrics withe the goals of the organization and how to help developers balance the needs of the organization with the needs of the open source community.
